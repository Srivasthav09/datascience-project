## **Input and Output**

### **Input:**
- Customer reviews of mobile phones from Flipkart in textual format.
- Corresponding product metadata such as brand, model, and ratings.
- Pre-processed text after cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.

### **Output:**

## **Methodology**  

### **Data Processing**
1. **Cleaning:**  
   - Removed HTML tags, decoded emoticons, and handled special characters to ensure clean and standardized text data.

2. **Tokenization:**  
   - Split reviews into sentences and words using word tokenization, preparing the data for model training.

3. **Text Normalization:**  
   - Removed stop words and performed stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their root form for better model learning.

4. **Balancing:**  
   - Applied antonym augmentation to balance the dataset, specifically targeting negative reviews to ensure a more representative training set.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed review lengths, active reviewers, and common terms using bar plots and word clouds to understand the dataset better.
- Conducted target distribution and n-grams analysis for deeper insights into the nature of reviews and sentiments.

### **Modeling**
Three models were trained and evaluated for aspect-based sentiment analysis:

1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
2. **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)**
3. **Enhanced BiLSTM (Proposed)**

These models were trained using different hyperparameter configurations, as detailed below.

   - **Batch Size:** 64

2. **LSTM_hparam2**
   - **Embedding Dimension:** 64
   - **LSTM Units:** 128
   - **Dropout Rate:** 0.4
   - **Learning Rate:** 0.0005
   - **Epochs:** 30
   - **Batch Size:** 64

3. **LSTM_hparam3**
   - **Embedding Dimension:** 128
   - **LSTM Units:** 128
   - **Dropout Rate:** 0.5

## **Conclusion**
The project demonstrated the effective use of advanced AI techniques for aspect-based sentiment analysis on mobile phone reviews. **LSTM** outperformed other models in terms of overall performance across various metrics. However, **Enhanced BiLSTM** also showed promising results in terms of recall for the positive class. The findings suggest that **LSTM** is the best model for sentiment analysis in this case, and it can be further fine-tuned for even better performance. This approach not only aids in understanding customer sentiments but can also be leveraged for making data-driven decisions in the mobile phone e-commerce sector.
